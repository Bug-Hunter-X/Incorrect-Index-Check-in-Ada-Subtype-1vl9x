This repository demonstrates a common error in Ada programming involving subtypes and array bounds.  The `Check_Index` function intends to verify if an index is within the valid range of the `My_Arr` array. However, it uses the subtype `Positive`'s range instead of the array's actual range.  The solution corrects this behavior by directly comparing the index against the array's bounds.
